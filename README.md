# Project Overview
This project is one that will allow the user to utilize a search bar in order to find artists, playlists and whole albums that most closely match their search criteria. This will be done through the use of the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and will include both frontend and backend. The frontend is based off of a predetermined design but implemented by me within the project.

# Prerequisites
NodeJS<br/>
npm <br/>
Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge<br/>
MongoDB Compass<br/>


# Getting Started
Create a .env file within the api directory, fill it out DATABASE_URL with your mongodb link.
Then open 2 terminals and cd into the api folder in one of them and run npm start in that terminal window,
then in the other cd into spotify-react and run npm start as well. You should see the project running on http://localhost:3000

# Links

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - The homepage for the application<br/>
[http://localhost:3001/spotify](http://localhost:3001/spotify) - Will be more robust in future, just returns a static JSON currently
