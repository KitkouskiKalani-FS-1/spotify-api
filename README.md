# Project Overview
This project is one that will allow the user to utilize a search bar in order to find artists, playlists and whole albums that most closely match their search criteria. This will be done through the use of the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and will include both frontend and backend. The frontend is based off of a predetermined design but implemented by me within the project.
